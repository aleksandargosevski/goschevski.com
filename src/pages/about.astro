    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Aleksandar Goševski, a software engineer from Serbia. My journey into programming began in 2007 when I discovered HTML and CSS. Since then, I've had the pleasure of learning and working with various technologies, including PHP, JavaScript, Node.js, Go, Lua, and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work as a Staff Software Engineer at CarStory (now part of Vroom), where I help build and improve our systems every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding for work, you'll often find me tinkering with my development setup and <a href="https://github.com/goschevski/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> – it's a bit of a hobby of mine to create the perfect coding environment!
    </p>
    <h3>Specialities</h3>
    <ul class="specialties">
      <li><strong>Software Architecture</strong> — I enjoy designing clean and efficient systems that are both scalable and easy to maintain. Think of it as building a solid foundation for digital houses that can grow over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Front-End</strong> — My journey has taken me through many JavaScript frameworks, from the classic jQuery and Backbone.js to modern tools like Vue.js. While I may spend less time with CSS these days, I'm passionate about creating websites that are both accessible and user-friendly.</li>
      <li><strong>Back-End</strong> — I love working with the engines that power websites and applications. Over the years, I've built many APIs and backend services, always focusing on creating reliable and efficient solutions that just work.</li>
      <li><strong>Tooling</strong> — I enjoy making developers' lives easier by setting up helpful tools and workflows. Whether it's automating code checks or streamlining the development process, I'm always looking for ways to help teams work better together.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I believe in keeping things simple and getting things done. I'm always excited to learn new things and tackle interesting challenges. If you have a project in mind or just want to chat about technology, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
