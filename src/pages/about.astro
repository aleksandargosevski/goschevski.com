    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Aleksandar Goševski, a software engineer from Serbia. My journey into programming began in 2007 when I discovered HTML and CSS. Since then, I've had the pleasure of learning and working with various technologies, including PHP, JavaScript, Node.js, Go, Lua, and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work as a Staff Software Engineer at CarStory (now part of Vroom), where I help build and improve our systems every day. Additionally, I run a small <a href="https://www.godacode.com">software development studio</a> with a few friends, where we create custom software solutions and handle website design and development projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding for work, you'll often find me tinkering with my development setup and <a href="https://github.com/aleksandargosevski/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> – it's a bit of a hobby of mine to create the perfect coding environment!
    </p>
    <h3>Specialities</h3>
    <ul class="specialties">
      <li>Software Architecture</li>
      <li>Technical Leadership</li>
      <li>Front-End (Vue.js, Astro, Nuxt, etc.)</li>
      <li>Back-End (Node.js, PHP, Go, etc.)</li>
      <li>Tooling (git, docker, bash, tmux, neo(vim) etc.)</li>
      <li>CI/CD (ansible, bash, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I believe in keeping things simple and getting things done. I'm always excited to learn new things and tackle interesting challenges. If you have a project in mind or just want to chat about technology, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
