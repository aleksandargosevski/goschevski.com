When you are interviewing someone, you can learn more about them by reviewing how they did some exercises than talking with them about specific technology. Anyone can learn theory from the blog posts, but people rarely understood it. To be sure that candidate knows about the topic they are talking about, it's a good thing to test their knowledge with exercises. Exercises shouldn't take too long, and they can instantly show you a skill level of the candidate.

### Context (call, apply)

This is how we want to use `someFn`. Candidate should define it.

```javascript
var result = someFn({ someProperty: 'interview' }, function () {
  console.log('This pointing to', this)
})

console.log('Result is', result)

// expected output
// This pointing to { someProperty: 'interview' }
// Result is 1
```

Solution:

```javascript
var someFn = function (obj, cb) {
  cb.call(obj)
  return 1
}
```

#### Bonus

You can change function to check if candidate knows how to use `apply`.

```javascript
var result = someFn(
  { someProperty: 'interview' },
  function (param1, param2) {
    console.log('This pointing to', this)
    console.log('Param 1 is', param1)
    console.log('Param 2 is', param2)
  },
  ['cool', 'interview']
)

console.log('Result is', result)

// expected output
// This pointing to { someProperty: 'interview' }
// Param 1 is "cool"
// Param 2 is "interview"
// Result is 1
```

Solution:

```javascript
var someFn = function (obj, cb, params) {
  cb.apply(obj, params)
  return 1
}
```

### Prototype and Iteration

Define a native method called `each` for iterating over the array with an option to pass the context as a second argument.

```javascript
var arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr.each(function (arrayItem, counter) {
  console.log('index', counter)
  console.log('item', arrayItem)

  arr[counter] = arrayItem + 1
}, this)
```

Solution:

```javascript
Array.prototype.each =
  Array.prototype.each ||
  function (cb, context) {
    for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
      cb.call(context || this, this[i], i)
    }
  }
```

### Scope

Define `someFn` which can work like this.

```javascript
var counter = someFn(1)
console.log('First call', counter(3))
console.log('Second call', counter(1))
console.log('Third call', counter(5))

// expected output
// First call 4
// Second call 5
// Third call 10
```

Solution:

```javascript
var someFn = function (start) {
  var private = start

  return function (increment) {
    private += increment

    return private
  }
}
```
